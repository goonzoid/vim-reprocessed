# reprocessed.vim

A plugin to make it easy to work with the Processing language.
It is originally based on
[sophacles/vim-processing](https://github.com/sophacles/vim-processing),
which was in turn an extension of vim script
[#2115](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2115).

## Installation

If you're not using either [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)
or [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen),
I highly recommend that you check them out.

### Install with Vundle

Add this to your vimrc in the appropriate place:

    Bundle "willpragnell/vim-reprocessed"

And install:

    :so ~/.vimrc
    :BundleInstall

### Install with Pathogen

Just clone it:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/willpragnell/vim-reprocessed.git

## TODO

* Cleanup and update syntax file for Processing 2
* Remove applescript and implement some platform agnostic equivalent
