# Contributing

Contributions of any size are always appreciated.

For any non trivial piece of work, please raise an issue so that we can chat
about it and avoid any duplication of effort.

## Pull Requests

Please consider the following guidelines before submitting a pull
request:

* Any non-documentation changes should be on a topic branch.
* Commits should be small, logical units.
* There should be no trailing whitespace whatsoever in any file (you can check
for this with `git diff --check` before committing).
* The coding style should be consistent, follow the conventions you see in the
source already. In particular, spaces should be used for indentation in all
cases - no tabs please!
* Commit messages should formatted sensibly and written in the imperative,
present tense, e.g. `add CONTRIBUTING.md` rather than `added CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Contact
